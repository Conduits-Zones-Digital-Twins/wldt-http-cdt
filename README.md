# SIDI - Conduit Digital Twin (CDT)

Conduit Digital Twin (CDT), providing the abstraction of connectivity among different zones while 
satisfying given requirements. In particular, a CDT represents a communication template among ZDTs, 
listing not only performance requirements (e.g., in terms of bandwidth, latency/jitter, and packet loss) 
but also security require-ments (e.g., if and how packets flowing among ZDTs connected by the CDT should be signed and/or ciphered).
